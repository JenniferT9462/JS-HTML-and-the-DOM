# JS HTML and the DOM

## Day 1
### Pet Owner Sign-Up Form

 Create a simple HTML form that collects information about a pet owner and stores the data in a global JavaScript object called state. The form will not submit data to a server but will log the state object to the console.

    NOTE: This time, don't include a input with type of "submit" in your form. We don't want to submit the form. We want to capture the data in JavaScript. So instead of a "submit" input, use a button with type of "button".

## Day 2
### Pet Owner Factory Function

 In this assignment, you will create a factory function called createPetOwner that generates a petOwner object with a render method. This method will display the pet owner's details on the webpage when a button is clicked. You'll update the webpage dynamically by setting the textContent of specific DOM elements.

    Note: This will extend your work on your previous assignment from day 1.
